# MList :D

This is the Bare bones of an idea, a program to save progress of some serial media 
(like mangas, books or movies, something like this)

## Installation

Check the MangaList/VendorPremake/readme.txt file, follow that, then 
run the premake5.lua on the root (using premake of course)

example:
```bash
dir/to/premake/premake5.exe vs2019
```

change 'vs2019' to your desired action

(Check more info about premake here: https://premake.github.io/docs/What-Is-Premake)

## Dependencies

All dependencies are listed on de 'Dependencies.lua' file

## Usage

The plan is to have to ways if using this, a stand alone .exe 
and a API (maybe a GUi in the future)

## Contributing

I never dealt with this, but you can send a pull request and i will try to see that
